                <h2>How does JavaScript work?</h2>
                <p>Most of the article in various websites they said that JavaScript is a single thread programming
                    language. That means javascript can do one task at a time. Javascript works with the help of
                    Google's V8 engine. Call stack and memory heap is the two part of the engine. During compilation of
                    a javascript program all the primitive data like integers, strings, booleans etc are being allocated
                    in heap while the non-primitive data
                    like objects and arrays are allocated in the heap during runtime.
                    As javascript can do one task at a time, when a task like function found, the call stack then send
                    it to the top of the stack. When the function execution is done, it poped from the stack and then it
                    goes to the next.
                    Let a code be like: <br>
                    <code>
                        const firstFunction = () > {<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log('First function called');<br>
                        }
                        <br>
                        firstFunction();
                    </code>
                    <br>
                    The program will reach to <code>firstFunction()</code> and push it to the top of the stack. Then the
                    called function will find the code <code>console.log('First function called');</code> and then put
                    it
                    the the top of the stack. Then at first log the statement <q>First function called</q> and pop it.
                    Then pop the <code>firstFunction()</code>.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>What does JavaScript event loop do?</h2>
                <p>
                    Event loop in JavaScript is a relative topic to the first question. We know that javascript is a
                    single thread programming language. It can't do two or more tasks at a time. Normal tasks like line
                    by line instruction can be executed easily. But when fetching data from API, calling big function,
                    time functions like setInverval() are delayed the program execution. If
                    <code>setTimeout(do something, 5000);</code> then the program will stuck for 5 seconds and do the
                    'do something' task and step to the next. It's a problem. <br>
                    This problem is solved by the event loop. When a task arive, the JS send it to the call stack. If
                    the task take time to fetch the data or execute, then it pop to the list of the async code. When
                    async code is ready to execute, then it goes to the queue. The rest async code will appear in the
                    queue one by one orderly and wait for the stack to be freed. <br>
                    When the stack gets empty, the queue then push each element ony by one and then The stack then does
                    it's work.
                </p>

                <h2>What is the difference between local storage and session storage?</h2>
                <p>Local storage and session storage are both the phenomana of websites. Local storage is the storage
                    which saves data permanently until it removed manually. Normally the user information like shopping
                    cart items are saved in the local storage. It's data won't be deleted if the tab is closed or the
                    browser is closed. <br>
                    Session storage is a temporary storage that a website saves. The data which are saved in the session
                    storage are deleted when the tab is closed. </p>
